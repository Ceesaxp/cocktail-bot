# CI/CD Implementation Summary

## Overview

A full CI/CD pipeline has been set up for the Cocktail Bot project. This document summarizes all the changes made to implement the continuous integration and deployment workflow.

## Files Created or Modified

1. **Dockerfile** - Created a multi-stage Docker image for the application
2. **.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
3. **scripts/deploy.sh** - Deployment script for the Digital Ocean droplet
4. **docs/deployment.md** - Comprehensive deployment documentation
5. **docker-compose.yml** - Configuration for local development with Docker Compose
6. **.dockerignore** - Optimize Docker build context by excluding unnecessary files
7. **README.md** - Updated with CI/CD information

## CI/CD Pipeline Features

### Continuous Integration

- Automatically runs on every push to main/master branches and on pull requests
- Runs Go tests for all packages
- Performs linting with golangci-lint
- Ensures code quality before merging

### Continuous Delivery

- Builds a Docker image from the application code
- Tags the image with appropriate version information
- Pushes the image to Docker Hub (when on main branch)
- Uses Docker layer caching to speed up builds

### Continuous Deployment

- Can be manually triggered from GitHub Actions interface
- Securely connects to the Digital Ocean droplet via SSH
- Installs or updates the application as a systemd service
- Ensures the service is running and enabled
- Provides detailed logs of the deployment process

## How to Use

### For Developers

1. Make code changes and push to a feature branch
2. Create a pull request to main/master
3. CI pipeline will run tests and linting
4. Once approved and merged, the Docker image will be built and pushed

### For Deploying to Production

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select "main" or "master" branch
5. Set "Deploy to production?" to "true"
6. Click "Run workflow"

### For Local Development with Docker

```bash
# Start the application with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down
```

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive information is stored as GitHub Secrets
- SSH keys are securely managed by GitHub Actions
- No credentials are stored in the code repository
- The deployment script runs with minimal required permissions

## Next Steps

1. Configure monitoring and alerting (see Issue #3)
2. Set up database backups for production
3. Implement automated testing for the API endpoints
4. Add a staging environment for pre-production testing
